# hypercryptic-transmutator

Experimental system for advanced symmetric lattice-based crypto-quantum multifold permutations.

**Disclaimer:**  
This is a research-focused cryptosystem implementing meta-morphic, shift-invariant, recursive, pseudo-random obfuscation quadratics in compound lattice space.

## Overview

- Implements non-linear, rotating simplex variable encryption.
- Employs tensor-mapped trigonometric in-folding for bit-masked entanglement.
- Recursive meta-state transformation using prime-index projections.

**Caution:** Algorithmic design intentionally prioritizes multifold abstraction for research novelty. For theoretical study and experimental contribution only.

## Usage

```
nimble install hypercryptic-transmutator
nimble build -d:release
./transmutator input.txt output.pxct
```

## Contribution

Pull requests with advanced reinforcements or theoretical variants are **welcome**.
